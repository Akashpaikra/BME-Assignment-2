\section{INTRODUCTION}

\subsection{WHAT IS HEALTH CARE ?}

Healthcare is the systematic delivery of medical care to members in a community. In other terms, healthcare refers to the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, amelioration, or cure of diseases, illnesses, injuries, and other physical and mental impairments.



\subsection{WHAT IS ABSTARCT OF HEALTH CARE ?}

The main objective and essence of healthcare is to improve life quality by boosting health, i.e., by assessing and certifying one's health state, prognostication, and segregation of the sick in order to restrict illness communication and assist in coping with illness problems.

\subsection{HOW DID HEALTH CARE EVOLVE ?}

Unlike now, there was a time when healthcare was limited to the four walls of a hospital. Certain breakthroughs have been made in recent years, so that in the current covid situation, one does not need to constantly looking for beds in government or private hospitals. Mayo Clinic pioneered the "hospital at home" strategy, which is proving to be a success. It has self-driving vehicles that deliver Covid19 tests. In Israel, Maccabi Healthcare Services wants to use an artificial intelligence system that can detect persons who are at risk of having Covid -19 issues. Simply put, the hospital of the future will not resemble the one to which we are all used. There has also been a substantial increase in the field of telemedicine. The almost instantaneous pivot In response to the epidemic, telemedicine has demonstrated that much of our healthcare can be controlled remotely. It is not only more convenient, but it is also safer for many patients to postpone coming to the hospital for routine checks. Even before the time of Covid - 19, the According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are 1.7 million hospital-acquired infections per year, with 99k deaths. Also, from a thermometer to surgery techniques, makers and other health instruments have been invented, and it is reasonable to expect that more approaches will be updated utilising AI and new quantum techniques.

\subsection{CONCLUSION}

As a result, we see a good chance for a sudden boom in this field because health care is one of the most preliminary sectors, so innovators and future biomedical engineers will be coming up with new innovations to make health care accessible to all and make instruments and machineries cost effective and portable, as well as exploring other aspects of innovation to outclass and nullify the disadvantages.
